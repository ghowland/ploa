## PLoA: Programming Layers of Abstractions

PLoA is a website for describing how I have learned to work with abstractions, and the tools by which I make decisions when I program.

I am going to create this website using a combination of tools in my github repo: 

 - TemplateMan to format the HTML pages with their data
 - DirDB to track all of the projects, chapters and additional meta-data
 - SchemaMan to manage the DirDB schema.

This is all purposefully low-tech because it makes it easier to share in a variety of formats.  The usable database and all operations to create the static website can be synced into github or other version management systems, and anyone who checks them out can work with the entire process.

I will be pushing the final web pages to Amazon S3, which will host the website from a DNS backed bucket.
